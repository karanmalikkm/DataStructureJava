/*
Q) You are given a number A and a number B. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between A and B inclusive
is taken (GCD(A, A+1, A+2 â€¦ B)).
As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers A and B can be in the range of 10^100.

You have to return the value of GCD found.

Greatest common divisor of 2 numbers A and B is the largest number D that divides both A and B perfectly.

Problem Constraints:
1 <= A <= B <= 10^100

Solution:
There can be following cases:
Case1: if A==B, GCD is the number itself
Case2: GCD of N natural numbers = 1
